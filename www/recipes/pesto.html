    <h3>Ingredients</h3><hr>
    Ingredients
    
Chicken
1/2 cup basil pesto<br>
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (2 oz)<br>
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 oz each)<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
Topping
1 can (14.5 oz) Muir Glen™ organic fire roasted diced tomatoes<br>
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br>
4 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 4 slices<br>


<h3>Directions:</h3><hr>
Heat oven to 400°F. Line large, rimmed sheet pan with foil. Place wire rack on top of foil. Spray with cooking spray.<br>

In small bowl, mix pesto and Parmesan cheese. In thick side of each chicken breast, cut 3-inch-long pocket to within 1/4 inch of opposite side of breast. Spoon<br>about 2 rounded tablespoons pesto mixture into pocket in each chicken breast. Brush olive oil on both sides of chicken, and place on rack. Sprinkle with salt.<br>

Roast uncovered 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and stuffing in chicken reaches internal temperature of 160°F.<br>

Meanwhile, in 1 1/2-quart saucepan, heat tomatoes to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 7 to 8 minutes, pressing with wooden spoon to<br> break down tomatoes, until sauce thickens. Remove from heat; cover pan to keep warm.<br>

Brush chicken breasts with balsamic vinegar; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake 3 to 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Top with tomato sauce.<br>
