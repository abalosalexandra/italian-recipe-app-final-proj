     <h3>Ingredients</h3><hr>
	 
1 packet spaghetti<br>
100 g bacon, cut in strips<br>
3 eggs<br>
1 egg yolk<br>
100 g Pecorino Romano or Parmesan - grated<br>
1 Tbsp olive oil<br>
Lots of black pepper - coarsely crushed<br>
Salt to taste<br>
 
<h3>Directions:</h3><hr>
In a large pan or a saucepan, heat the olive oil and fry the bacon till crisp. Set aside.<br>
In a mixing bowl, beat the whole eggs and the yollk well. Stir in the grated cheese and set aside.<br>
Boil the spaghetti in abundant salty water. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.<br>
In another saucepan, toss the pasta with the egg mixture, bacon and any fat rendered from cooking the bacon, over very low heat.<br>
Make sure that the individual strands of pasta are all coated properly with the mixture. Season with salt, add the pasta water, give it a quick toss, and remove right away from the heat.<br>
The sauce should have a creamy texture, which will be lost if the pasta remians on the fire for too long.<br>
The idea is to cook the egg with the heat of the pasta, and not with the heat of the fire.<br>
Serve right away with lots of pepper, freshly crushed in a pepper mill, and more Parmesan if desired.<br>
